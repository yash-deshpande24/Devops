## Question 3:
**What is sdlc?**

**Answer** The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a step-by-step process used to plan, create, test, and deliver good-quality software in an organized and efficient way.

## Question 4:
**What are steps in sdlc?**

**Answer**  Steps in SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle):
- 1.Requirement Gathering – Understand what the client needs.

- 2.Planning – Check if the project is technically and financially possible.

- 3.Design – Plan the architecture, UI, and data flow.

- 4.Implementation (Coding) – Developers write the actual code.

- 5.Testing – QA team checks for bugs and verifies functionality.

- 6.Deployment – Software is delivered to users or clients.

- 7.Maintenance – Fix issues and update the system post-deployme

## Question 5:
**What are models in SDLC?**

---

### 1. 🔹 Waterfall Model
**Definition:**  
The Waterfall model is a simple and step-by-step model where each phase must be completed before the next one begins.

**Steps:**  
`Requirement → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance`

**Example:**  
Like building a house—first plan, then lay the foundation, then build walls. You cannot go back once you move to the next step.

---

### 2. 🔹 Agile Model
**Definition:**  
Agile is a flexible and fast model where the project is built in small parts called **sprints**. You get feedback from users after each sprint.

**Example:**  
Like creating a mobile app feature-by-feature and showing it to users every 2 weeks.

### 3. 🔹 Spiral Model
**Definition:**
The Spiral model combines design and prototyping with frequent risk analysis. The project is developed in loops (spirals), and each loop addresses risks.

**Example:**
Like designing a car—test each prototype with safety checks before building the next version.

### 4. 🔹 V-Model (Verification and Validation)
**Definition:**
An extension of the Waterfall model where testing is planned in parallel with development. Each development phase has a corresponding testing phase.

**Example:**
Like preparing for an exam and testing yourself after each topic.

### 5. 🔹 Incremental Model
**Definition:**
In this model, the software is developed and delivered in small chunks (increments). Each increment adds a new feature.

**Example:**
Like building a restaurant menu one section at a time—first drinks, then starters, then main course.

### 6. 🔹 RAD (Rapid Application Development) Model
**Definition:**
RAD focuses on fast development and quick delivery with user involvement through prototypes.

**Example:**
Like quickly creating a sample of a website, showing it to the client, improving it, and finalizing it.

### 7. 🔹 Big Bang Model
**Definition:**
The Big Bang model is used for small projects with very little planning. Developers start coding with the available resources.

**Example:**
Like cooking a new recipe without a plan or ingredients list—just start and adjust as you go.


## Question 6:
**What is Deveops?**

| **File Size**     | Same as the original file.                        | Different from the original file.             |
| **Inode Number**  | Same as the original file.                        | Different from the original file.             |
| **File Deletion** | The hard link remains unaffected if the original file is deleted. | The soft link becomes invalid if the original file is deleted. |
| **Directories**   | Hard links to directories are not possible.       | Soft links to directories are possible.       |
| **Link Count**    | Affects the link count (increases or decreases by 1. | Does not affect the link count.              |

# Networking

## Question 176:
**what is networking?**  
**Answer:** A network is collection of devices connected to each other to allow sharing of data.

---

## Question 177:
**What is Addressing?**

**Answer**
- Addressing in networking means giving every device a unique identity to send and receive data. 
- The main types are Logical(IP ) addressing for devices, MAC addressing for hardware, and port addressing for apps or services. 
- It helps in accurate data delivery across networks.

---

## Question 178:
**What is Logical Addressing?**

**Answer**
Logical addressing is a way to identify devices using software-based addresses, like IP addresses, so they can communicate across networks (like the internet). It is used by the network layer to send data from one device to another, even if they are on different networks.

---

## Question 179:
**Types of Logical Addressing?**

**Answer**
The two main types of logical addressing are IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is widely used but has limited addresses, while IPv6 supports a much larger address space for future internet growth.

---

## Question 180:  
**What is an IP address?**

**Answer:**  
An IP address is a unique number given to each device on a network so it can communicate with other devices.

---

## Question 181:  
**What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?**

**Answer:**  
- IPv4 is a 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)  
- IPv6 is a 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:0db8::1)  
- IPv6 provides more addresses and better security than IPv4.

---

## Question 182:  
**Why do we need IPv6?**

**Answer:**  
IPv4 addresses are limited and almost full. IPv6 gives us billions of new addresses, which are needed for the growing number of internet devices.

---

## Question 183:  
**What is the format of an IPv4 address?**

**Answer:**  
IPv4 is written in 4 decimal numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.0.1), each number ranges from 0 to 255.

---


## Question 184:  
**What is the format of an IPv6 address?**

**Answer:**  
IPv6 is written in 8 groups of hexadecimal numbers separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334)

---

## Question 185:  
**How many addresses are available in IPv4 and IPv6?**

**Answer:**  
- IPv4: About 4.3 billion addresses  
- IPv6: Around 340 undecillion addresses


---

## Question 186:  
**What is the loopback address in IPv4 and IPv6?**

**Answer:**  
- IPv4: 127.0.0.1  
- IPv6: ::1  
Used to test the network interface of your own device.

---

## Question 187:  
**What is the difference in security between IPv4 and IPv6?**

**Answer:**  
IPv6 has built-in IPsec (encryption and authentication), while IPv4 requires it as an optional feature.

## Question 188:  
Can IPv4 and IPv6 work together?  
**Answer:**  
Yes, using dual stack or tunneling, both can work together during the transition from IPv4 to IPv6.

## Question 189:  
What are private IP ranges in IPv4?  
**Answer:**  
- 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255  
- 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255  
- 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255  
Used in local/private networks.

---

## Question 190:  
**What are the main advantages of IPv6 over IPv4?**

**Answer:**  
- More address space  
- Better security  
- No
