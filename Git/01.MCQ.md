# ðŸ“˜ Git & Version Control System (VCS) Interview Q&A

## 1. What is Version Control System (VCS)?
 Track changes make in code over time. Version control systems solve this problem by managing all versions of the code, but presenting the team with a single version at a time.

---

## 2. Features of VCS
- Tracks history of changes
- Allows collaboration among multiple developers
- Supports branching and merging
- Provides backup and recovery
- Shows differences between versions
- Helps manage large projects efficiently

---

## 3. What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system, that managing versions of data.

---

## 4. Name other VCS
- **Centralized VCS**: SVN (Subversion), CVS, Perforce
- **Distributed VCS**: Git, Mercurial, Bazaar

---

## 5. What is Delta-based Version Control?
The information they store as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time (this is commonly described as delta-based version control).

Example: CVS, SVN.

---

## 6. How Git Stores Data?
Git stores data as **snapshots** (complete state of files at a point in time), not deltas.  
Each commit is a snapshot of the project with a pointer to the previous commit.

---

## 7. Command to Set Username and Email

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

---

## 8. What is centralized vcs?
A Centralized Version Control System (CVCS) is a version control system where there is one central server that stores the codebase and all versions of the project.

---

## 9. What is Distributed VCS?
A **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)** is a type of VCS where **every developer has a complete copy of the repository**, including its history. Developers can commit, branch, and work offline, then sync with others when connected.

âœ… Examples: **Git, Mercurial, Bazaar**

---

## 10. Mechanism Used by Git
- Git uses **snapshots** instead of deltas.  
- Each commit is identified using a **SHA-1 hash (40 characters)**.  
- Data is stored inside the hidden `.git` folder.  
- Git objects:
  - **Blob** â†’ file content
  - **Tree** â†’ directory structure
  - **Commit** â†’ snapshot + metadata
  - **Tag** â†’ reference to specific commit

---

## 11. States of Git
A file in Git can be in one of three states:
1. **Modified** â†’ File changed but not staged.  
2. **Staged** â†’ File marked to be committed.  
3. **Committed** â†’ File saved in local repository.

## 12. Difference Between CVCS and DVCS

| Feature              | CVCS (Centralized VCS)         | DVCS (Distributed VCS)     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Repository storage    | Only on central server          | Every user has full copy    |
| Offline work          | Not possible                   | Possible                    |
| Single point failure  | Yes (server crash = loss)       | No (copies exist everywhere)|
| Speed                 | Slower (network dependency)     | Faster (local operations)   |
| Examples              | SVN, CVS, Perforce              | Git, Mercurial              |

---

## 13. What is `git revert` Command?
- Used to **undo a commit** by creating a **new commit** that reverses the changes.  
- Does not delete history (safe way to undo).

```
git revert <commit-hash>
```

---

## 14. What is `git restore`?
The `git restore` command is used to **discard changes in the working directory or unstage files**. 

---



## 15. What is key pair generate command?
```
ssh-keygen
```
---

## 16. What is `git merge`?
Used to combine changes from one branch into another.

---

## 17. What is `git rebase`?
Used to move commits from one branch onto another base to create a clean, linear history.

---

## 18. What is `git fetch`?
Used to download commits, branches, and tags from a remote repository into your local repository â€” without merging them into your current branch.

---

## 19. What is diference between git merge and git rebase?

| Feature      | Git Merge ðŸŸ¢ | Git Rebase ðŸ”µ |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| History      | Keeps full history (non-linear) | Creates linear history |
| Commit Style | Adds a merge commit | Moves commits on top of target branch |
| Use Case     | Preserve branch history | Clean, linear project history |
| Safety       | Safe for shared branches | Avoid on shared branches |


---


## 20. What is `git pull`?
Command is used to fetch changes from a remote repository and immediately merge them into your current branch.

---


## 21. What is `git stash`?
Temporarily saves (stashes) uncommitted changes in a stack, so you can work on something else without committing.

---

## 22. What is `git cherry-pick`?
Copy one specific commit from one branch to another.

---

## 23. What is `git checkout -b hotflix`?
Create branch and switch also.

---

## 24. What is git workflow?
