## üìò What is Multi-Stage Build?
A **multi-stage Docker build** allows using multiple `FROM` statements in a single Dockerfile.  
Each `FROM` starts a **new stage**, and you can **copy only required files or dependencies** from one stage to another.

This approach helps in creating **smaller, faster, and more secure Docker images**.

---

## üí° Why Use Multi-Stage Builds?
When building applications, we often need heavy tools and dependencies during build time (like `pip`, `npm`, or compilers).  
However, these are **not required at runtime**.  

So, with **multi-stage builds**, you can:
- Use a **heavy image** for building (Stage 1)
- Use a **lightweight image** for running (Stage 2)

‚úÖ Reduces image size  
‚úÖ Improves performance  
‚úÖ Increases security

## üß± Example: Multi-Stage Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# ---------- Stage 1: Builder ----------
# Base image with full Python setup (~1 GB)
FROM python:3.7 AS builder

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# ---------- Stage 2: Final Image ----------
# Lightweight base image (~140 MB)
FROM python:3.7-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy installed dependencies from builder stage
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/ /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/

# Copy remaining project files
COPY . .

# Run the application
ENTRYPOINT ["python", "run.py"]

```

## üß† Explanation of Dockerfile?

Line	Description
FROM python:3.7 AS builder	Stage 1: Full Python environment for installing dependencies
WORKDIR /app	Sets the working directory inside container
COPY requirements.txt .	Copies dependency list into the container
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt	Installs all Python dependencies
FROM python:3.7-slim	Stage 2: Lightweight Python image (~140 MB)
COPY --from=builder ...	Copies dependencies from Stage 1
COPY . .	Copies your app source code
ENTRYPOINT ["python","run.py"]	Defines container start command
üì¶ Why Image Size Reduces (1 GB ‚Üí 140 MB)
Stage	Base Image	Size	Purpose
Builder	python:3.7	~1.04 GB	Full Python + Build tools
Final	python:3.7-slim	~140 MB	Minimal runtime environment

In the final image, only essential runtime dependencies are copied ‚Äî not temporary build files or pip cache.
That‚Äôs why the image size reduces drastically.

## üß∞ Useful Commands
Command	Description

docker history <image>	Show image layer sizes
docker rmi <image>	Remove an image
