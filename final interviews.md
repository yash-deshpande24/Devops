DEVOPS INTERVIEW QUESTIONS & ANSWERS (1.5 YEARS EXPERIENCE)
========================================================

SECTION 1: HR & INTRODUCTION
----------------------------

Q1. Tell me about yourself.
A. I’m a Cloud & DevOps Engineer with around 1.5 years of hands-on experience working on AWS and DevOps tools. 
I have worked with AWS services like EC2, VPC, IAM, ALB, Auto Scaling, and EKS. 
I have implemented CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins and GitHub, containerized applications using Docker, 
and deployed them on Kubernetes. I also have experience with Terraform, Linux administration, 
monitoring, and troubleshooting.

Q2. Why did you switch from Backend to DevOps?
A. While working on backend development, I became more interested in how applications are deployed, scaled, 
and monitored in real environments. I enjoyed automation, CI/CD, and cloud infrastructure work more, 
so I upskilled in AWS and DevOps tools and transitioned into DevOps.

Q3. What is DevOps?
A. DevOps is a set of practices that combines development and operations to deliver applications faster, 
with better quality and reliability using automation and continuous feedback.

SECTION 2: AWS
--------------

Q4. What is EC2?
A. EC2 is a virtual server in AWS used to run applications where we manage OS, security, and scaling.

Q5. What is EKS?
A. EKS is a managed Kubernetes service by AWS that helps deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications.

Q6. Difference between EC2 and EKS?
A. EC2 runs applications directly on virtual machines, while EKS runs containerized applications using Kubernetes.

Q7. How do you secure an EC2 instance?
A. By using IAM roles, security groups, key-based SSH, private subnets, OS patching, and disabling unused ports.

Q8. What is IAM?
A. IAM is used to manage users, roles, and permissions in AWS securely.

Q9. What is Auto Scaling?
A. Auto Scaling automatically increases or decreases EC2 instances based on traffic or load.

Q10. What is VPC?
A. VPC is a virtual network in AWS that allows us to isolate and control networking resources.

SECTION 3: CI/CD & JENKINS
--------------------------

Q11. What is CI?
A. CI means automatically building and testing code whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

Q12. What is CD?
A. CD means automatically deploying the application to staging or production environments.

Q13. Explain your Jenkins pipeline.
A. My Jenkins pipeline includes code checkout, build, test, Docker image creation, pushing to registry, 
and deployment to servers or Kubernetes.

Q14. What is Jenkinsfile?
A. Jenkinsfile is a file that defines CI/CD pipeline as code.

SECTION 4: DOCKER
------------------

Q15. What is Docker?
A. Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications and dependencies together.

Q16. Difference between Docker image and container?
A. An image is a template, and a container is a running instance of an image.

Q17. What is Dockerfile?
A. Dockerfile contains instructions to build a Docker image.

SECTION 5: KUBERNETES
---------------------

Q18. What is Kubernetes?
A. Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool used to manage containerized applications.

Q19. What is a Pod?
A. A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.

Q20. What is a Deployment?
A. Deployment manages replicas, updates, and rollbacks of Pods.

Q21. What is a Service?
A. Service exposes Pods to internal or external traffic.

Q22. What is rolling update?
A. Rolling update updates Pods gradually without downtime.

SECTION 6: TERRAFORM
--------------------

Q23. What is Terraform?
A. Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code tool used to provision cloud resources.

Q24. What is Terraform state?
A. Terraform state keeps track of created resources.

Q25. How do you manage Terraform state?
A. By storing state in S3 and locking it using DynamoDB.

SECTION 7: LINUX
----------------

Q26. What is Linux?
A. Linux is an open-source operating system widely used in servers.

Q27. How do you check running processes?
A. Using ps, top, or htop commands.

Q28. How do you check disk usage?
A. Using df -h and du commands.

SECTION 8: MONITORING & TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------------------------------

Q29. What is monitoring?
A. Monitoring tracks system health, performance, and availability.

Q30. What tools have you used for monitoring?
A. Amazon CloudWatch and Datadog.

Q31. What is an alert?
A. An alert notifies teams when a metric crosses a threshold.

SECTION 9: SCENARIO-BASED QUESTIONS
-----------------------------------

Q32. What will you do if production goes down?
A. Check monitoring alerts, logs, identify root cause, rollback if needed, and fix the issue.

Q33. How do you handle deployment failure?
A. Rollback to previous stable version and analyze logs.

Q34. How do you reduce downtime?
A. Using rolling updates, load balancers, and auto scaling.
