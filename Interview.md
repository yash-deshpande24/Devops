# Git Questions

**Q1: What is the difference between git pull and git fetch?**  
- **git fetch**: Downloads the latest changes from the remote repository but does not merge them into your current branch. It's like checking what's new.  
- **git pull**: Does a git fetch and then automatically merges those changes into your current branch. It's a "fetch and update" in one command.

**Q2: How do you commit changes in Git?**  
You use the `git commit` command. First, you add the files you want to commit with `git add <filename>`, then you create the commit with `git commit -m "Your commit message"`.

**Q3: How do you resolve a merge conflict in Git?**
- Open the file with the conflict. You'll see markers like `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` showing the conflicting changes.
- Manually edit the file to choose which changes to keep. Remove the conflict markers.
- Save the file.
- Add the fixed file with `git add <filename>`.
- Complete the merge with `git commit`.

**Q4: What is the git cherry-pick command?**  
It lets you take a specific commit from one branch and apply it to another branch. It's like copying and pasting a single commit.

**Q5: What is the git stash command used for?**  
It temporarily saves your uncommitted changes, giving you a clean working directory. This allows you to switch branches or work on something else, and then come back later and reapply your saved changes with `git stash pop`.

# Docker Questions

**Q6: What are the benefits of using Docker?**
- **Consistency**: It runs the same way on any machine (your laptop, a server).
- **Isolation**: Apps run in separate containers, so they don't interfere with each other.
- **Efficiency**: Containers are much lighter and start faster than virtual machines.

**Q7: What is the difference between Docker and a Virtual Machine?**
- A Virtual Machine includes a full operating system (OS) on top of the host OS, making it heavy.
- A Docker Container shares the host OS kernel, making it very lightweight and fast to start.

**Q8: What is a Dockerfile?**  
It's a text file with instructions (like a recipe) for building a Docker image. It tells Docker what base image to use, what files to copy, and what commands to run.

**Q9: Explain the concept of Docker Compose.**  
It's a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. You use a `docker-compose.yml` file to configure all your app's services (like a web server, database) and start them all together with a single command.

**Q10: What is Docker Swarm?**  
It's Docker's own built-in tool for clustering and orchestrating Docker containers. It allows you to manage a group of Docker hosts as a single virtual system.

**Q11: What is the Docker lifecycle?**  
The main states are: Create a container -> Run it -> Stop it (can be started again) -> Delete it.

**Q12: Why are workloads optimized when using Docker?**  
Because containers are lightweight, you can run many more applications on a single server compared to virtual machines, using your hardware resources (CPU, RAM) more efficiently.

**Q13: Explain the concept of Docker volumes.**  
Volumes are the preferred way to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. They store data outside the container, so it isn't lost when the container is deleted.

**Q14: What are the network types in Docker?**  
Common ones are:
- **bridge**: Default network for containers to communicate with each other.
- **host**: Removes network isolation between the container and the host.
- **none**: Disables all networking for the container.

**Q15: How can you monitor a Docker container?**  
Use the `docker stats` command to see live performance data, or use `docker logs` to see what the container has output.

**Q16: How do you deploy a three-tier project in Docker?**  
You would create a Dockerfile for each tier (e.g., one for the frontend, one for the backend, one for the database). Then, you would use Docker Compose to define and run all three containers together, linking them so they can talk to each other.

# Kubernetes (K8s) Questions

**Q17: What is container orchestration?**  
It's the automated process of managing the lifecycle of containers, especially in large, dynamic environments. It handles deployment, scaling, networking, and ensuring the containers are healthy.

**Q18: How do you deploy a three-tier application on Kubernetes?**
You create a set of configuration files (YAML) for each tier:
- A Deployment for the frontend, backend, and database (or a StatefulSet for the DB).
- A Service for each one to expose them to the network and enable communication between the tiers.

**Q19: What is a ReplicaSet?**  
It's a Kubernetes object that ensures a specified number of identical pod copies (replicas) are running at all times. If a pod crashes, the ReplicaSet starts a new one.

**Q20: What is the concept of rolling updates in Kubernetes?**  
It's a way to update an application with zero downtime. Kubernetes gradually replaces old pods with new ones, one by one, ensuring some instances of your app are always available during the update.

**Q21: How do you control identity and access in Kubernetes?**
Using RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). You create definitions for:
- **ServiceAccount** (an identity for processes in pods).
- **Role/RoleBinding** or **ClusterRole/ClusterRoleBinding** (to define permissions and assign them to the identity).

# Jenkins Questions

**Q22: What are the key features of Jenkins?**  
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD). It automates the process of building, testing, and deploying software.

**Q23: How are you using Jenkins in your organization?**  
(Sample Answer) We use it to automate our build and deployment pipeline. Whenever a developer pushes code to Git, Jenkins automatically pulls the code, builds it, runs tests, and if everything passes, deploys it to a test server.

**Q24: How do you integrate into Jenkins?**  
Jenkins integrates with many tools using plugins. For example, you use the Git plugin to pull code from a Git repository, and the Email-ext plugin to send notifications.

**Q25: What are Jenkins agents?**  
Agents (formerly called "slaves") are other machines that connect to the main Jenkins server to help run jobs. This distributes the workload.

**Q26: How can you secure Jenkins?**  
By enabling authentication (login), setting up user permissions with the Matrix Authorization Strategy, and keeping Jenkins and its plugins updated.

**Q27: How do you create a user in Jenkins?**  
Go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Users > Create User.

**Q28: How do you send a notification to email for a failed pipeline?**  
You use the post section in your Jenkinsfile (or pipeline configuration) and define an action for the failure condition, typically using the mail or emailext command.

# Terraform Questions

**Q29: What is a Terraform module?**  
It's a container for multiple Terraform resources that are used together. It's like a reusable function that you can call to create a set of infrastructure (e.g., a "network module" that creates a VPC, subnets, etc.).

**Q30: What is a Terraform state (tfstate) file?**  
It's a file that Terraform uses to keep track of the real-world resources it has created. It maps your configuration file to the actual IDs of the cloud resources. It must not be lost.

**Q31: What is the terraform taint command?**  
It marks a specific resource in the state file as "tainted." This tells Terraform to destroy and recreate that resource on the next terraform apply.

**Q32: How do you manage secrets and sensitive files in Terraform?**
- Use environment variables.
- Use secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault or cloud-native secret stores (AWS Secrets Manager).
- Never commit plain-text secrets to your version control.
