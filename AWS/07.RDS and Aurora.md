# AWS RDS Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. What is RDS?
Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is a managed service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud without managing hardware, software, or backups manually.

## 2. Advantages of RDS


### Advantages of Amazon RDS

#### 1. Supports Popular Databases
You can use engines you already know:
- MySQL  
- PostgreSQL  
- MariaDB  
- Oracle  
- SQL Server  
- IBM Db2  

---

#### 2. Automated Management
RDS takes care of:
- Backups  
- Software updates/patches  
- Automatic failure detection  
- Recovery  

---

#### 3. Backups & Restore
- Automated backups (daily) or manual snapshots.  
- Easy and reliable restore process.  

---

#### 4. High Availability & Scalability
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Primary + Standby DB (auto failover).  
- **Read Replicas**: Increase read performance by offloading read traffic.  

---

#### 5. Security
- Control access with **IAM (Identity & Access Management)**.  
- Place databases inside a **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** for network-level protection.

## 3. What are Database Engines?
Database engines are the underlying software that manages how data is stored, queried, and maintained.  
**Examples supported by RDS:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Oracle, SQL Server, Amazon Aurora.

---

## 4. What is DB Instance Storage?
DB Instance Storage is the allocated disk space (in GBs) for your database instance.  
**Types:** General Purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS SSD, Magnetic.

---

## 5. What is NTP Protocol?
NTP (Network Time Protocol) is used by RDS to synchronize the system clock of database instances with accurate time servers.

---

## 6. What is a DB Instance?
A DB Instance is the basic building block of RDS. It is an isolated database environment where you can run multiple databases.

---

## 7. What is a Database?
A Database is an organized collection of data that can be accessed, managed, and updated.

---

## 8. Types of DBMS
- **Relational DBMS (RDBMS):** Stores data in tables with rows and columns (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).  
- **Non-relational DBMS (NoSQL):** Stores data as key-value pairs, documents, graphs, or wide-columns (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB).

---

## 9. Relational vs Non-Relational Database
- **Relational DB:** Structured, uses SQL, schema-based, best for transactions.  
- **Non-Relational DB:** Flexible schema, unstructured/semi-structured, best for scalability and big data.

---

## 10. Limitations of RDS
- Limited control over the underlying OS.  
- Max storage size and connection limits.  
- Restricted customization compared to self-managed DBs.  
- Cost may be higher for very large workloads.

---

## 11. Automated Backups vs Snapshots in RDS
- **Automated Backups:** Continuous backups managed by RDS, retained for a set period (1–35 days). Automatically deleted after the retention period.  
- **Snapshots:** User-initiated backups, stored until you manually delete them.

---

## 12. What are Read Replicas in RDS?
Read replicas are copies of your primary database that handle **read-only queries**, helping scale read-heavy workloads. They also improve performance without impacting the main DB.

# AWS Aurora Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. What is Aurora?
Amazon Aurora in AWS is a fully managed relational database engine developed by Amazon Web Services.

Amazon Aurora is a fast, reliable, and cost-efficient cloud-native database that combines the strengths of open-source engines (MySQL/PostgreSQL

## 2. difference between aurora and rds?

# Aurora vs RDS (Simple Difference)

| Feature            | RDS                          | Aurora                          |
|--------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Engine Support     | Many (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MariaDB) | Only MySQL & PostgreSQL |
| Speed              | Normal performance           | 3–5x faster                     |
| Storage            | Fixed size (manual scaling)  | Auto scales up to 128 TB        |
| Availability       | Multi-AZ (2 copies)          | 6 copies across 3 AZs           |
| Read Replicas      | Up to 5                      | Up to 15                        |
| Cost               | Cheaper for small workloads  | Slightly higher, but faster      |
| Management         | Fully managed by AWS         | Fully managed by AWS             |

✅ **In short:** Aurora = High speed + Auto scale + High availability (but only MySQL/PostgreSQL).

---

## 3. How aurora works with rds?
Aurora is a database engine inside Amazon RDS that supports MySQL and PostgreSQL.
It uses the same RDS features (console, CLI, API) for tasks like provisioning, backups, recovery, and failover.
Unlike normal RDS, Aurora manages a cluster of servers with built-in replication and auto-scaling storage, making it faster and highly available.

Data from RDS MySQL/PostgreSQL can be migrated to Aurora using snapshots or replication.

---

## 4. What is Aurora db clusters?
- An Aurora DB cluster = **DB instances + cluster volume**.
- **Cluster volume** = shared storage across multiple AZs (copies of data in each AZ).

## Types of DB Instances
1. **Primary (Writer) DB Instance**
   - Handles **read + write**.
   - Only **one primary** per cluster.
   - Applies all changes to cluster volume.

2. **Aurora Replicas (Reader) DB Instances**
   - Up to **15 replicas** per cluster.
   - **Read-only** (share same storage as primary).
   - Used for **scaling reads** and **high availability**.
   - Can be placed in **different AZs**.
   - If primary fails → **failover to replica** (priority can be set).

✅ In short: Aurora DB cluster = **1 writer + up to 15 readers**, all sharing **auto-replicated storage** across AZs.
