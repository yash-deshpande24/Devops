# AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) Q&A

## 1. What is IAM?
IAM (Identity and Access Management) is an AWS service that helps you securely manage **who can access AWS resources and what actions they can perform**.

---

## 2. What is an IAM User?
- A digital identity in AWS for people or applications.  
- Each user has credentials (username, password, access keys).  
- Permissions are attached through policies.  

---

## 3. What is an IAM Group?
- A collection of IAM users.  
- Permissions given to the group apply to all its users.  
- Example: `Developers` group, `Admins` group.  

---

## 4. What are IAM Policies?
IAM Policy is a JSON document in AWS that defines permissions (Allow or Deny) for users, groups, or roles, specifying what actions can be performed on which resources.

## 5. Difference between Identity-based and Resource-based Policies
| Feature       | Identity-based Policy                 | Resource-based Policy              |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Attached To   | IAM users, groups, roles              | AWS resources (e.g., S3 bucket)    |
| Control       | What a user/role can do               | Who can access the resource        |
| Example       | IAM user allowed to start EC2         | S3 bucket policy allowing public read |

## 6. Difference between Inline and Managed Policies
| Feature       | Inline Policy                         | Managed Policy                     |
|---------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Attachment    | Directly attached to one user/group/role | Attached to group of users,groups,roles|
| Reusability   | Cannot be reused                      | Can be reused across identities    |
| Management    | Harder to maintain                    | Easier to manage                   |
| User delete  | Policy also delete                     | Policy remain                      |

## 7. What is an IAM Role?
- A temporary identity in AWS with specific permissions.  
- Used by AWS services, applications, or users to assume permissions **without using permanent credentials**.  

### Types of Roles
1. **Service Role** – Used by AWS services (e.g., EC2 accessing S3).  
2. **Cross-Account Role** – Grants access to users from another AWS account.  
3. **Identity Federation Role** – Allows external users (Google, Facebook, corporate AD) to access AWS.

## 8. What is MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)?
- An extra layer of security requiring **two authentication factors**:  
  1. Password or access key (something you know).  
  2. OTP from a device/app (something you have).  
- Protects accounts from unauthorized access.
