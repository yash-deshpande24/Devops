# Amazon CloudWatch – Interview Questions & Answers

## 1. What is Amazon CloudWatch?
**Answer:** Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that helps track metrics, logs, and events for AWS resources and applications in real time.  

---

## 2. What is a Metric in CloudWatch?
**Answer:** Metrics are data about the performance of your systems.Metric data is kept for 15 months, enabling you to view both up-to-the-minute data and historical data. 
Example: CPUUtilization, NetworkIn, DiskReadOps etc.  

## States of a Metric Alarm

- **OK** – The metric or expression is within the defined threshold.  
- **ALARM** – The metric or expression is outside of the defined threshold.  
- **INSUFFICIENT_DATA** – The alarm has just started, the metric is not available, or not enough data is available to determine the alarm state.

## 3. What is an Alarm in CloudWatch?
**Answer:** An alarm watches a metric and performs actions when the metric reaches a threshold.  
Example: Send an SNS notification when CPU > 80% for 5 minutes.  

## Alarm Types in CloudWatch

### 1. Metric Alarm
- Monitors a single metric or math expression.  
- Triggers actions when thresholds are crossed.  
- **Actions:**  
  - SNS notification  
  - EC2 actions (stop, reboot, terminate, recover)  
  - Auto Scaling actions  
  - Create OpsItem/incident  

---

### 2. Composite Alarm
- Combines multiple alarms with rule expressions.  
- Goes to **ALARM** only if all rule conditions are met.  
- Reduces alarm noise (alert only when multiple alarms trigger).  
- **Actions:**  
  - SNS notification  
  - Create OpsItem/incident  
  - ❌ Cannot perform EC2 or Auto Scaling actions  


---

## 4. What is APM (Application Performance Monitoring)?
**Answer:** 
- **Definition:** APM helps monitor and analyze how your applications perform.  
- **Features:**  
  - Tracks requests, errors, latency, and dependencies.  
  - Detects performance bottlenecks.  
  - Provides end-to-end visibility using **CloudWatch ServiceLens** and **AWS X-Ray**.  
- **Use:** Helps improve application performance and troubleshoot issues faster.  


---

## 5. How does CloudWatch Work?
**Answer:**  

- Collects **logs, metrics, and events** from AWS and on-premises resources.  
- Visualizes data in **dashboards** for a unified view of system health.  
- Correlates metrics and logs to analyze performance.  
- Supports **alarms**:
  - Based on thresholds.  
  - Detect anomalies using machine learning.  
- Triggers **automated actions**:
  - Send notifications (SNS).  
  - Start Auto Scaling to fix issues quickly.  
- Allows deep analysis of metrics, logs, and traces to improve performance.

## 6. What are the States of a CloudWatch Alarm?
**Answer:**  
- **OK:** Metric is within threshold.  
- **ALARM:** Metric has crossed the threshold.  
- **INSUFFICIENT_DATA:** Not enough data to determine state.  

---

## 7. What are the Alarm Types in CloudWatch?
**Answer:**  
- **Metric Alarm:** Based on a single metric or math expression.  
- **Composite Alarm:** Combines multiple alarms into one.

  ## Alarm Types in CloudWatch

### 1. Metric Alarm
- Monitors a single metric or math expression.  
- Triggers actions when thresholds are crossed.  
- **Actions:**  
  - SNS notification  
  - EC2 actions (stop, reboot, terminate, recover)  
  - Auto Scaling actions

- Reduces alarm noise (alert only when multiple alarms trigger).  
- **Actions:**  
  - SNS notification  
  - Create OpsItem/incident  
  - ❌ Cannot perform EC2 or Auto Scaling actions   

---

## 8. What is Action Status in Alarms?
**Answer:** Alarm actions define what happens when the alarm state changes. Actions include:  
- Sending SNS notifications.  
- Triggering Auto Scaling policies.  
- Stopping, terminating, rebooting, or recovering an EC2 instance.  

---

## 9. What is the Default Period in CloudWatch?
**Answer:** The default metric period is **5 minutes**.  
With high-resolution metrics, you can set periods as low as **1 second**.  

---

## 10. What is an SNS Notification in CloudWatch?
**Answer:** SNS (Simple Notification Service) is used to send alerts when an alarm state changes.  
Notifications can be delivered via email, SMS, or trigger a Lambda function.  
- Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) is a fully managed service that provides message delivery from publishers (producers) to subscribers (consumers). Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by sending messages to a topic, which is a logical access point and communication channel.

## 11. What are the Features of CloudWatch?
**Answer:**  
## Features of Amazon CloudWatch

- **Monitoring:** Collects metrics, logs, and events from AWS resources and applications.  
- **Dashboards:** Visualize system performance in a single view.  
- **Alarms:** Trigger actions or notifications when thresholds are crossed.  
- **Custom Metrics:** Allows users to publish their own application metrics.  
- **Logs & Traces:** Analyze logs and application traces for performance insights.  
- **Automated Actions:** Integrates with Auto Scaling, EC2 actions, and SNS notifications.  
- **Application Monitoring (APM):** ServiceLens + X-Ray for application performance analysis.  
- **Integration:** Works with AWS services like EC2, Lambda, RDS, EKS, S3, and Systems Manager.

## 12. What is a Dynamic Policy in Auto Scaling and its Types?
**Answer:** Dynamic scaling policies in Auto Scaling use CloudWatch metrics to automatically adjust capacity.  
Types:  
1. **Target Tracking Scaling:** Keeps a metric at a target value (e.g., CPU at 50%).  
2. **Step Scaling:** Changes capacity in steps based on thresholds.  
3. **Simple Scaling:** Adds or removes a fixed number of instances.  

---

## 13. What are Custom Metrics in CloudWatch?
**Answer:** Custom metrics are user-defined metrics that can be published to CloudWatch using the `PutMetricData` API.  
Example: Number of active users, orders processed per minute.  

---

## 14. What are Metric Types in CloudWatch?
**Answer:**  
- **Standard Metrics:** Provided by AWS services by default.  
- **Custom Metrics:** Created and pushed by users.  
- **High-Resolution Metrics:** Collected at intervals as low as 1 second.  

---

## 15. How is AWS Systems Manager used with CloudWatch?
**Answer:**
- **Integration:** SSM can work with CloudWatch to automate tasks when an alarm goes off.  
- **Automated Actions:** Can run predefined scripts (runbooks) for maintenance or fixing issues.  
- **Parameters:** Stores important info like passwords or AMI IDs securely, which CloudWatch can use in automation.  


---

## 16. What are Parameters in Systems Manager (SSM)?
**Answer:**
- **Definition:** Key-value pairs used to store configuration data securely.  
- **Examples:** Passwords, API keys, AMI IDs, or any important settings.  
- **Use:** Can be accessed by CloudWatch or automation scripts to perform tasks safely.
