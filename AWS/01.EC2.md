# AWS & Networking Q&A

## 1. What is EC2?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a cloud service by AWS that provides virtual servers (instances) to run applications. You can choose CPU, memory, storage, and network capacity as per your need.

---

## 2. What is SSH?
SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used to securely connect to remote servers or computers. It encrypts the communication and is commonly used to log into Linux servers.

---

## 3. What is RDP?
RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is developed by Microsoft. It allows you to connect to and control a Windows machine remotely with a graphical interface.

---

## 4. What is a Web Server?
A web server is software or hardware that serves web pages to users over the internet. Examples: Apache, Nginx, IIS.

---

## 5. What is HTTP and HTTPS?
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for transferring data between a web server and browser. 
HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. It uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect data transfer, ensuring security and privacy.

---

## 6. Difference between Start and Enable (in Linux services) 
- **start** → Immediately starts the service, but it won’t start automatically after reboot.  
- **enable** → Configures the service to automatically start at system boot.  

---

## 7. What is a Firewall?  
A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic.

## 8. What is the difference between Static and Dynamic Websites?  
| Feature            | Static Website                          | Dynamic Website                          |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Content            | Fixed (same for all users)              | Changes based on user/data                |
| Technology         | Built with HTML, CSS                    | Uses server-side code (PHP, Python, etc.) |
| Speed              | Very fast (just shows files)            | Slower (needs processing)                 |
| Cost               | Cheap to host                          | More expensive to host                    |
| Example            | Personal portfolio, info pages          | Facebook, Amazon, Banking sites           |
|Database            | No database                             | Database present                          |

## 9. What are Instance Types in EC2?  
Instance Types are:
- General Purpose: Provide balance of compute(cpu), memory(ram), networking power.
- Compute Optimized: Have very powerful CPU processors and use when need lot of calculaions.
- Memory Optimized: Fast Performanance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.
- Accelerated Computing: Have extra hardware to do complex tasks fatser than regular CPU.
- Storage Optimized: Handle very large amounts of data store on local disks and allow for fast reading and writing of that data. 



---

## 10. What are EC2 Purchasing Options?  
- On-Demand Instances → Pay per hour/second, no commitment. Good for short-term or unpredictable workloads.

- Reserved Instances → Pay less if you commit for 1 or 3 years. Good for steady workloads.

- Spot Instances → Buy unused capacity at very low cost. Can be stopped anytime by AWS. Good for flexible jobs.

- Savings Plans → Like Reserved, but more flexible. Commit to spend ($/hour) for 1 or 3 years, works across services.

- Dedicated Hosts/Instances → Physical servers just for you. Good for compliance or special licensing needs.

- Capacity Reservations → Reserve capacity in a specific AZ. Pay whether you use it or not.

---

## 11. What is an AMI?  
AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a template that contains the software configuration (OS, applications) needed to launch an EC2 instance.

---

## 12. What is EBS?  
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides scalable, high-performance block storage resources that can be used with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances. With Amazon Elastic Block Store, you can create and manage the following block storage resources:

---

## 13. What are Volume Types in EBS?  
EBS Volume Types

## 1. SSD-backed Volumes
*Fast, low-latency, good for random read/write like databases*

### General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3)
- Balances price and performance
- Suitable for most workloads (boot volumes, apps, dev/test)

### Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2)
- Designed for high performance
- Best for databases, OLTP systems, or apps needing consistent IOPS

---

## 2. HDD-backed Volumes
*High throughput, low cost, good for sequential workloads like big data*

### Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
- Best for streaming workloads like big data, data warehouses, log processing

### Cold HDD (sc1)
- Lowest-cost storage
- Suitable for infrequently accessed data

---

## 3. Magnetic (Standard) 
*Old type*

- Earlier generation volume
- Low cost, but very slow performance
- Mostly deprecated, replaced by SSD and HDD options


---

## 14. Difference between SSD and HDD? 

| Feature         | SSD                        | HDD                     |
|-----------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Storage Type    | Flash memory (no moving parts) | Magnetic disks (spinning) |
| Speed           | Fast (high read/write)     | Slow (lower read/write) |
| Durability      | More durable (less prone to damage) | Less durable (can fail if dropped) |
| Noise           | Silent                     | Makes noise             |
| Cost            | Expensive                  | Cheaper                 |

## 15. What is a File System?  
A file system organizes data on a storage device (e.g., ext4, NTFS, FAT32).  

---

## 16. What is Disk Partition?  
Partitioning divides a physical disk into logical parts called partitions to manage and organize data.  

---

## 17. What is Temporary and Permanent Mount?  
- Temporary Mount: Attaching a storage device or partition to a directory only for current session. 
- Permanent Mount: Attaching  a disk or partition in such a way that it remains mounted automatically every time the system reboots.
---

## 18. What is a Snapshot?  
A snapshot is a backup of an EBS volume at a specific point in time.  

---

## 19. What is a Placement Group?  
Grouping of ec2 instances within  same or different  AZ in same rack.

low latency so communication is quicker.

High availability.

Types of Placement Groups:
- Cluster: All server are in one rack.
- Spread: Each server on completely differently rack to avoid them failing together.
- Partition: Each server on different different location.

---

## 20. What is Load Balancing?  
Load balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve availability and performance.  

---

## 21. What is a Target Group?  
A target group is a group of resources (EC2 instances, IP addresses, Lambda functions) that receive traffic from a load balancer.  

---

## 22. What are the Types of Load Balancers in AWS?  
- Application Load Balancer (ALB): It can distribute incoming traffic distributed in different server. It work on Application Layer.
  
- Network Load Balancer (NLB): It handle millions of request per second. It work on Transport Layer.
  
- Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB): It deploy, scale, manage virtual application.
    
- Classic Load Balancer (CLB): Old generation load balancer in AWS. Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances to improve availability and fault tolerance. 

---

## 23. What is Path-Based Routing?  
Path-based routing routes traffic based on the URL path.  

---

## 24. What is Auto Scaling?  
Auto Scaling automatically increases or decreases the number of EC2 instances based on demand.  Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps you ensure that you have the correct number of Amazon EC2 instances available to handle the load for your application. 

---

## 25. What are the Types of Scaling?  
- **Vertical Scaling**: Change instance size (scale up/down).  
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add or remove instances (scale out/in).
- Types of Horizontal Scaling:
- 1] Dynamic Scaling: Automatically add or removes ec2 instances  based on real time metrics.
- 2] Scheduled Scaling: Scaling at specific time and dates that you know.
- 3] Predicive Scaling: Forcast future using machine learning algorithms.

---

## 26. What is a Template in EC2?  
A Launch Template is a reusable blueprint to launch EC2 instances with predefined settings (AMI, instance type, key pair, security groups, etc.).  

---

## 27. What is an Elastic IP?  
An Elastic IP is a public ip and work as static.
