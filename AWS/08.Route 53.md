# Amazon Route 53 and DNS Concepts – Q&A

## 1. What is Amazon Route 53?
Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service provided by AWS.  
It is mainly used for domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking of resources.

---

## 2. What is the main function of Route 53?
The main function of Route 53 are:

#### 1. Domain Registration
- Route 53 lets you register a domain name (like `example.com`).
- This gives your website or application a unique name.

#### 2. DNS Routing
- Connects users’ browsers to your website or application.
- Routes internet traffic when someone types your domain/subdomain.
- Example: typing `example.com` → Route 53 connects it to your server.

#### 3. Health Checking
- Monitors your resources (like web servers).
- Checks if they are reachable and working.
- Can send alerts and automatically reroute traffic if a server is unhealthy.

## 3. What is an Alias Record in Route 53?
Alias Record is a special type of DNS record in Route 53 that lets you map your domain name to AWS resources without needing to remember or update IP addresses.

---

## 4. What is an Authoritative Name Server?
Authoritative Name Server is the server that has the final and correct information about your domain name and its DNS records.

---

## 5. What is a DNS Resolver?
These server are first in DNS check process. Resolve DNS queries from clients and resolve human-readable domain name to an IP address. 

---

## 6. What is DNS?
DNS is a hierarchical and distributed naming system that translates domain names into IP addresses.

---

## 7. What is a Hosted Zone in Route 53?
A container for records, which include information about how you want to route traffic for a domain and all of its subdomains.

---

## 8. What is an IP Address?
A number that is assigned to a device on the internet—such as a laptop, a smart phone, or a web server—that allows the device to communicate with other devices on the internet.

## 9. Difference between IPv4 and IPv6
| Feature          | IPv4                             | IPv6                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Address Length   | 32-bit (e.g., 192.168.1.1)       | 128-bit (e.g., 2001:db8::1)   |
| Address Space    | ~4.3 billion addresses           | Virtually unlimited           |
| Format           | Dotted decimal notation          | Hexadecimal notation          |
| Example          | 192.0.2.1                        | 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334|

## 10. What is a DNS Record?
An object in a hosted zone that you use to define how you want to route traffic for the domain or a subdomain.

---

## 11. What is a Routing Policy in Route 53?
A routing policy defines **how Route 53 responds to DNS queries**.  
Types include:  
- Simple – One resource, one record (e.g., single web server).
- Failover – Active-passive setup (primary + backup).
- Geolocation – Route based on user’s location.
- Geoproximity – Route based on resource location (can shift traffic between regions).
- Latency – Sends users to region with lowest latency.
- IP-based – Route based on user’s IP address.
- Multivalue Answer – Return multiple healthy IPs (like round robin).
- Weighted – Split traffic by percentage (e.g., 70%-30%).
---

## 12. What is a Subdomain?
A domain name that has one or more labels prepended to the registered domain name. For example, if you register the domain name example.com, then www.example.com is a subdomain. 

---

## 13. What is Time to Live (TTL)?
The time (in seconds) that a DNS record is stored (cached) by DNS resolvers before checking again with Route 53.

---

## 14. What are the Components of Route 53?
- **Domain Registration** – Register and manage domains.

- DNS resolution translates the domain name into its server IP address.

1.Recursive DNS server (DNS resolver):
-First point of contact. Gets the domain name from the user and finds its IP address.

2.Root DNS server:
- Top-level servers.
- Tell the resolver which TLD server (like .com, .org) to contact.

3.TLD Name servers:
- Handle specific extensions (.com, .org, .net). Point the resolver to the authoritative server for that domain.

4.Authoritative DNS servers:
- Final stop. Store the actual DNS records (like IP address)

## 15. Port number of Route 53?
53
