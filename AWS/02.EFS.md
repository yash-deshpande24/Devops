# AWS EFS Q&A

## 1. What is EFS?  
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides serverless, fully elastic file storage so that you can share file data without provisioning or managing storage capacity and performance. 

---

## 2. What are the features of EFS? 
Main features of Amazon EFS are:
- **Scalable**: Automatically grows and shrinks with data.
- **Fully Managed**: No need to manage hardware or storage servers.
- **Shared Access**: Multiple EC2 instances can access the same file system.
- **High Availability & Durability**: Data is stored redundantly across multiple Availability Zones.
- **Performance Modes**: Supports General Purpose and Max I/O modes for different workloads.
- **Secure**: Supports encryption at rest and in transit.
- **NFS Support**: Works with standard Network File System (NFS) protocol.

---

## 3. What is NFS?
NFS (Network File System) is a distributed file system protocol that allows a user or system to access files over a network as if they were on local storage.

---

## 4. What is the port number of NFS?
NFS uses **TCP and UDP port 2049** for communication.

---
## 5. EFS file system types?
1. Regional File System (Recommended)

- Stores data across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) in a region.

- Provides high availability and durability.

- Even if one AZ goes down, your data is still safe and available.

- Best for critical applications where uptime and safety of data are important.

2. One Zone File System

- Stores data in only one Availability Zone.

- Cheaper than Regional.

- Still available if the AZ is healthy, but if the whole AZ is lost (fire, flood, etc.), your data may be lost.

- Designed for 99.999999999% durability against disk/host/rack failures.

- AWS Backup automatically protects One Zone data by replicating backups across 3 AZs.

---

## 5. EFS can be mounted on how many EC2 instances at the same time?
Multiple instances across multiple AZs


----

## 6. Which of the following is NOT a feature of EFS?

A) Automatic scaling
B) Multi-AZ storage
C) Object storage for images and videos
D) Fully managed service

- C) Object storage for images and videos

---

## 7. What is the durability design target of EFS storage classes?
99.999999999%

---

## 8. What kind of workloads does Amazon EFS support?
EFS supports a broad range of workloads by providing high throughput, IOPS, and low latency. It can scale to petabyte size and supports massively parallel access from multiple compute instances.

----

## 9. What is the recommended default performance mode for most workloads?
The General Purpose performance mode is the default and recommended for most workloads.

---

## 10. What is the Elastic throughput mode in EFS used for?
The Elastic throughput mode is designed to automatically scale throughput performance up or down depending on workload activity. It is useful when workload traffic is unpredictable or variable

----

## 11. Difference between General Purpose and Elastic Throughput modes?

| Feature    | General Purpose                             | Elastic Throughput                              |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Use case   | Latency-sensitive apps                      | Workloads with unpredictable or varying traffic |
| Throughput | Fixed performance optimized for low latency | Automatically scales throughput                 |
| Examples   | Web servers, CMS, home directories          | Data analytics, big data workloads              |

## 12. Amazon EFS Storage Classes?
Amazon EFS provides different storage classes based on how often you access data:
#### 1. EFS Standard
- Uses **SSD storage** → lowest latency.  
- Best for **frequently accessed files**.  
- All new data is first written here.  
- Can be moved (tiered) later to IA or Archive via lifecycle policies.  

#### 2. EFS Infrequent Access (IA)
- **Cost-optimized** for data accessed only a few times per quarter.  
- Suitable for less-used files that don’t need very low latency.  

#### 3. EFS Archive
- **Lowest cost** storage.  
- Best for data accessed a few times **per year or less**.  
- Works only with **Elastic throughput** file systems.  
- ⚠️ Once data is in Archive, you cannot change throughput mode to Bursting/Provisioned.
