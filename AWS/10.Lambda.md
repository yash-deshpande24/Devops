# AWS Lambda Q&A

## 1. What is Lambda service?
AWS Lambda is a **serverless compute service** that lets you run code without managing servers. You just upload your code, and Lambda automatically handles the execution, scaling, and availability.

## 2. What are the uses of Lambda?
- **Stream Processing**: Process real-time data (logs, clicks, IoT data, transactions).  
- **Web Applications**: Auto-scaling, highly available apps with API Gateway, CloudFormation, Step Functions.  
- **Mobile Backends**: Handle API requests with API Gateway + Lambda, integrate via AWS Amplify.  
- **IoT Backends**: Manage IoT device data and API requests.  
- **File Processing**: Trigger Lambda on S3 file uploads for real-time processing.  
- **Database Operations**: React to RDS/DynamoDB events (logging, replication, workflows).  
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Run cron-like jobs with EventBridge (maintenance, reports, archiving).

## 3. What is a Lambda function?
A Lambda function is a piece of code that runs in response to events, such as a user clicking a button on a website or a file being uploaded to an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket.

## 4. What are the features of AWS Lambda?


#### Configure & Control
- **Environment Variables**: Change app behavior without new code.  
- **Versions**: Test safely while keeping stable production.  
- **Layers**: Share common code across functions.  
- **Code Signing**: Ensure only approved code is deployed.  

#### Scale & Performance
- **Concurrency Controls**: Manage scaling during traffic spikes.  
- **SnapStart**: Reduce cold start time to sub-seconds.  
- **Response Streaming**: Send large data in chunks.  
- **Container Images**: Deploy with complex dependencies.  

#### Connect & Integrate
- **VPC**: Secure access to private resources.  
- **File System Integration**: Share persistent data.  
- **Function URLs**: Create simple public APIs.  
- **Extensions**: Add monitoring and security tools.

## 5. What is the maximum execution time of a Lambda function?
The maximum execution time (timeout) for a Lambda function is **15 minutes (900 seconds)**.

---

## 6. What are the limitations of AWS Lambda?
- **Execution Timeout**: Max 15 minutes.  
- **Memory Limit**: 128 MB to 10 GB.  
- **Ephemeral Storage (/tmp)**: Default 512 MB, expandable up to 10 GB.  
- **Deployment Package Size**: 50 MB (zipped), 250 MB (unzipped with layers).  
- **Concurrent Executions**: Limited by account quota (can be increased by request).  
- **No GPU Support**: Only CPU and memory scaling.  
- **Cold Start Latency**: Some delay when functions are invoked after inactivity.
