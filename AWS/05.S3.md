# AWS S3 Interview Q&A

## 1. What is Amazon S3?
- Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is an **object storage service** that allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. 
- It is highly scalable, durable (99.999999999% durability), and secure.
  

---

## 2. What are the main features of S3?
- **Storage Classes** – Different options for frequent, infrequent, or archive data.
- Amazon S3 has storage management features that you can use to manage costs, meet regulatory requirements, reduce latency, and save multiple distinct copies of your data for compliance requirements.
- **Object Lock** – Protect files from delete/overwrite (compliance).
- **Replication** – Copy data to another bucket (same or different region).
- **Security** – IAM, bucket policies, block public access, encryption.
- **Versioning** - Add same name files in one bucket.
-

## 3. What is Replication in S3?
Replicate objects and their respective metadata and object tags to one or more destination buckets in the same or different AWS Regions for reduced latency, compliance, security, and other use cases.

## 4. What is Versioning in S3?
- S3 Versioning to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket.

## 5. What is the difference between Static and Dynamic Websites?

| Feature        | Static Website                        | Dynamic Website                      |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Content        | Fixed, same for all users             | Changes based on user/request         |
| Technology     | HTML, CSS, JS only                    | Server-side (PHP, Node.js, Python, DB)|
| Hosting        | Can be hosted on S3 or any web server | Needs server + database               |
| Speed          | Very fast (no processing)             | Slower (server processing needed)     |
| Use Case       | Portfolios, blogs, docs               | E-commerce, social media, dashboards  |

## 6. What is the difference between EBS, EFS, and S3?
| Feature            | EBS (Elastic Block Store) | EFS (Elastic File System) | S3 (Simple Storage Service) |
|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Storage Type       | Block Storage             | File Storage              | Object Storage              |
| Cost               | fixed size, pay for volume | Pay for used storage     | Pay for used storage        |
| Speed              | Very fast                 | Medium                    | Slower than both            |
| Use case           | OS,apps,database          | Shared file storage       | Backup, media, big-data     |

## 7. What is an S3 Storage Class?
Amazon S3 Storage Classes decide **how your data is stored, accessed, and priced**.  
They help balance **cost, performance, and availability** based on how often you use the data.


---

## 8. What are the types of Storage Classes in S3?
- **S3 Standard:** The default storage class means data is store in bucket. The data is  regularly use.   
- **S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access):** Used for storing  backups. Data is rarely accesed.
- **S3 Intelligent-Tiering:** Data is moved between infrequent access to standard and vice-versa.  
- **S3 One Zone-IA:** S3 stores the object data in only one zone.
- **S3 Glacier:** Store data for long time and data archieving.
- 
---

## 9. What is an S3 Lifecycle Rule/Policy?
- Object or data is shift to one storage class to another storage class automatically.

## 10. What is Server Access Logging in S3?
- Server Access Logging in S3 is a feature that provides detailed records of requests made to an S3 bucket, such as the requester, bucket name, request time, action, and response, mainly used for security, auditing, and monitoring.
---

## 11. What is a Pre-Signed URL in S3?
Pre-Signed URL in S3 is a temporary URL generated by AWS that grants time-limited access to private S3 objects without making the bucket public. 

---

## 12. What is a Bucket Policy in S3?
Define who can access bucket and what actions they can perform.  

---

## 13. What is the difference between Bucket Policy and IAM Policy?

| Feature        | Bucket Policy                          | IAM Policy                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Scope          | Applies to S3 bucket & objects         | Applies to IAM users, groups, roles |
| Type           | Resource-based policy                  | Identity-based policy                |
| Attachment     | Attached to bucket                     | Attached to user/role/group          |
| Control        | Who can access the bucket and how      | What resources a user/role can access|
