+# API Gateway — Interview Q&A
+
+## ✅ Basic Interview Questions & Answers
+
+1. **What is API Gateway?**
+
+   API Gateway is a fully managed AWS service used to create, secure, manage and publish APIs.
+
+2. **Why do we use API Gateway?**
+
+   We use API Gateway to expose backend services securely to clients with features like rate limiting, authentication, and monitoring.
+
+3. **How does API Gateway work with Lambda?**
+
+   API Gateway receives an HTTP request → triggers Lambda → Lambda runs code → response is sent back to the client.
+
+4. **What is the difference between REST API and HTTP API in API Gateway?**
+
+   REST API = full features, more expensive; HTTP API = lightweight, cheaper, and faster for simple use cases.
+
+5. **What are stages in API Gateway?**
+
+   Stages represent different deployment environments like dev, test, staging, prod for the same API.
+
+6. **What is an API key in API Gateway?**
+
+   API Key is a unique key used to identify and control access for clients using the API.
+
+7. **What is throttling in API Gateway?**
+
+   Throttling limits the number of API requests per second to protect the backend from overload or attacks.
+
+8. **What is CORS in API Gateway?**
+
+   CORS allows APIs to be accessed from different domains (e.g., frontend website calling backend API).
+
+9. **What are authorizers in API Gateway?**
+
+   Authorizers validate the client request using Lambda Authorizer or Amazon Cognito before API access is allowed.
+
+10. **How does API Gateway handle rate limiting?**
+
+    API Gateway enforces throttle limits + burst limits to control traffic and prevent abuse or overload.
+
+
+## 🔥 Scenario-Based / Real-Time Questions & Answers
+
+1. **If a client hits your API 10,000 times in 1 minute, how will API Gateway control the traffic?**
+
+   API Gateway applies rate limiting & throttling, slowing excessive requests and returning `429 Too Many Requests` if the limit is crossed.
+
+2. **How do you secure an API built with API Gateway?**
+
+   By using API Keys, IAM roles, Lambda Authorizer, Cognito authentication & AWS WAF.
+
+3. **If Lambda is slow, how does API Gateway respond?**
+
+   API Gateway waits for Lambda until the timeout limit, after which it returns a `504 Gateway Timeout`.
+
+4. **How do you version APIs in API Gateway?**
+
+   By deploying separate versions/stages (example: `/v1`, `/v2`) or using separate deployments under different stages.
+
+5. **How do you deploy changes from development to production in API Gateway?**
+
+   By deploying updates to different stages (dev → test → prod) using Stages + Stage Variables or CI/CD (CodePipeline).
+
+6. **How do you connect API Gateway with an internal VPC resource?**
+
+   By enabling VPC Link or Private Integration to securely call services hosted inside VPC (e.g., EC2 / ECS / NLB).
+
+7. **If API fails, how will you debug the issue?**
+
+   Enable API Gateway execution logs + Lambda logs in CloudWatch, and use X-Ray tracing for detailed debugging.
+
+8. **How do you reduce latency of API responses?**
+
+   Use CloudFront caching, larger Lambda memory (faster CPU), response caching, and HTTP API instead of REST API.
