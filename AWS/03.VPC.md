# AWS VPC and Networking Q&A

## 1. What is a Subnet?
- A network is divide into small networks called subnets.
- A subnet is a section of your VPC where you can place AWS resources like ec2 instances.
- Subnet has a range of IP addresses within your VPC.

## 2. What are Private IP Ranges?

#### üåê IP Address Classes and Ranges

| **Class**|        **Private IP Range**               |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| Class A  |  10.0.0.0 ‚Äì 10.255.255.255                |
| Class B  |  172.16.0.0 ‚Äì 172.31.255.255              |
| Class C  |  192.168.0.0 ‚Äì 192.168.255.255            |

## 3. What is VPC?
 It is private virtual network in the cloud where you can launch AWS servicees.

---

## 4. What is CIDR?
CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) defines IP address ranges using prefix notation.  
Example: `10.0.0.0/16` ‚Üí provides 65,536 IPs.

---

## 5. What are Reserved IPs?
In each subnet, 5 IP addresses are reserved by AWS:  
1. Network address: The first IP address in subnet  
2. VPC router: Handles routing within your vpc
3. DNS server: Name resolution within vpc  
4. Future use: Reserved for future use  
5. Broadcast address: Last ip

## 6. What is Classful and Classless Addressing?
#### $${\color{blue}\textbf {Classfull Addressing}}$$
- IP addresses are divided into fixed classes(A,B,C etc) with predifined sizes.
- You cannot change the network size so its not flexible.
- Example 192.168.0.0/8 , 192.168.0.0/16 , 192.168.0.0/24.

#### $${\color{blue}\textbf {Classless Addressing}}$$
- You can define your own network size using subnet masks.
- It gives more flexibility and save IP addresses
- Example 192.168.0.0/22 , 192.168.0.0/16.

## 7. What is an Internet Gateway?
An Internet Gateway (IGW) allows VPC resources to connect to the internet.

---

## 8. What is a Route Table?
A route table is a set of rules that decides how traffic is directed within a VPC (to subnets, internet, NAT, or other networks).

---

## 9. Difference between Default and Custom VPC?
- **Default VPC**: Created automatically by AWS, includes subnets, IGW, and route table by default.  
- **Custom VPC**: Created manually by the user, requires explicit configuration of subnets, gateways, and routes.  

---

## 10. What is a Private Subnet?
A private subnet is a subnet without a direct route to the internet (via IGW). Commonly used for databases and backend services.

---

## 11. What is a NAT Gateway?
A managed service that allows private subnet instances to access the internet securely without exposing them directly.

---

## 12. Difference between Security Group and NACL?
| Security-Group                       | NACL                                  |
|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Applied on instances                 | Applied on subnet level               |
| Stateful rule                        | Stateless rule                        |
| Everthing Denied(inbound), Allow all outbound | Allows all inbound and outbounds |
| Allow all rules | Allow/Deny|
| Check all rules before allowing traffic | Rules are checked in number order(lowest to highest)|  

---

## 13. What is an Elastic IP?
An Elastic IP is a static public IPv4 address that you can attach to an EC2 instance for consistent internet communication.

---

## 14. What are Peering Connections?
A VPC Peering Connection allows two VPCs to communicate with each other privately as if they were in the same network.
